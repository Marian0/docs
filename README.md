## About Goravel

Goravel is a web application framework with complete functions and good scalability. As a starting scaffolding to help
Golang developers quickly build their own applications.

框架与 [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) 保持高度一致，让 PHPer 不用学习新的框架，也可以愉快的写 Golang！

Goravel and Laravel remain highly consistent, let PHPer write Golang happily without learning a new framework!

Tribute Laravel!
